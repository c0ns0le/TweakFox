## How to create a Firefox Addon Collection Pack

The purpose of a Firefox collection addon pack is to facilitate the 
installation of two or more addons by packaging them into one 
convenient addon.

## How to create the FirefoxKeyAddons.xpi Addon Collection Pack

1) Create a new folder called "FirefoxKeyAddons".

2) Download your favourite addons and place them (a set of .xpi files) in the above folder.

3) Optionally, configure each individual addon according to your preferences.
   An individual addon can be customised by extracting it (an .xpi file is a 
   zip file), make the required changes, re-zip the files and rename the file 
   extension from .zip to .xpi

4) Copy the file "install.rdf" in to the "FirefoxKeyAddons" folder.

5) From Windows Explorer, select all of the files in the folder "FirefoxKeyAddons" and zip them as "FirefoxKeyAddons.zip".

6) Rename the file from "FirefoxKeyAddons.zip" to "FirefoxKeyAddons.xpi".


That's it.  Enjoy!
