## How to create a Firefox Addon Collection Pack

The purpose of a Firefox collection addon pack is to facilitate the 
installation of two or more addons by packaging them into one 
convenient addon.

## How to create the FirefoxKeyAddons.xpi Addon Collection Pack

1) Create a new folder called "FirefoxKeyAddons".

2) Download your favourite addons and place them (a set of .xpi files) in the above folder.

3) Optionally, configure each individual addon according to your preferences.
   The step are detailed in the next section.

4) Copy the file "install.rdf" in to the "FirefoxKeyAddons" folder.

5) From Windows Explorer, select all of the files in the folder "FirefoxKeyAddons" and zip them as "FirefoxKeyAddons.zip".

6) Rename the file from "FirefoxKeyAddons.zip" to "FirefoxKeyAddons.xpi".

That's it.  Enjoy!


## How to customise an individual addon.

1) Download the addon and save it to your working folder.

2) Unzip the addon (an .xpi file is a zip file) into a folder with the same name as the addon.

3) Make the required changes.

4) From Windows Explorer, select all of the files in the addon folder and zip them as <name_of_addon>.zip.

5) Rename the file extension from ".zip" to ".xpi".
